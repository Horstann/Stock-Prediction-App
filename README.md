# Hack4Pan Submission  
*A stock web app that allows users to see stock charts and stock price predictions using machine learning.*
---

This website is fully coded with Python, utilising the 'Streamlit' module to structure our web app.  

Our stock price prediction model is built using Data Science and Machine Learning libraries like 'Numpy', 'Pandas', 'Keras' and 'Tensorflow'.  

The 'Matplotlib' library was also used to visualize our data and construct our charts.
